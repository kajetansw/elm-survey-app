## Elm Survey App

Elm application with a small survey to be completed by the user. Demo application for "Why Elm is a delightful language to learn FP?" talk.

This project uses two awesome tools for the data API management:
- [Fauna DB](https://fauna.com/) and its GraphQL layer to store survey data
- [dillonkearns/elm-graphql](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql) for generating and using GraphQL queries in Elm

It also uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment.
